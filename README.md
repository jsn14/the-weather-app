# The Weather App

## About
This web application provides current weather conditions for a given city or geo-coordinates. The user can have weather data such as 
_temperature, humidity, visibility, pressure and current weather conditions._  
The application is written in VanillaJS and uses an API to fetch the data from the provider.  
>The app is designed without any frontend framework or library on purpose.

## Usage

```
>Application must have access to location service of the device to use.

```

## Future scope
This application can be forked to add tons of features and addons in the future.
